# Etch-a-sketch
The Etch-a-Sketch is a simple JavaScript program hosted on GitHub that allows users to draw a square grid and interact with it by changing the color of each square when hovering over it.

## Features
Grid Creation by flex: The program generates a square grid based on user input. Users can specify the number of rows and columns they want for the grid.

Interactive Drawing: By hovering the mouse cursor over any square in the grid, the program changes the color of that square. This feature enables users to draw on the grid simply by moving the cursor around.

Color Variations: Each square in the grid has a different color. The program generates a random color for each square, ensuring that the grid appears vibrant and visually appealing.

## Technologies Used
The Etch-a-Sketch program is implemented using the following technologies:

- JavaScript: The program is primarily written in JavaScript, a popular scripting language used for web development. JavaScript is responsible for handling user interactions and dynamically updating the grid's colors.

- HTML/CSS: The user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS. HTML provides the structure of the page, while CSS is responsible for the visual presentation, including the grid layout and hover effects.

- GitHub: The Etch-a-Sketch program is hosted on GitHub, a web-based platform for version control and code hosting. It allows users to easily view, download, and contribute to the project.
